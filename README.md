### Setup
NOTE: Python version must be 3.4 because that is what works with the server  

1. First create a virtual environment: ```virtualenv my_project_env```  
2. Next, activate the virtual environment: ```source my_project_env/bin/activate```  
3. Find this project's (idb) requirements.txt and install it: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Use ```deactivate``` at any time to leave the virtual environment

### How to Run
Navigate to the parent directory (by default it is "idb").  
Execute the command: ```python application.py```
  
### How to Test
Navigate to the parent directory (by default it is "idb").  
Execute the command: ```python -m app.tests```

### How to fill DB
Run with command: ```python -m app.scripts.fill_database``` (it might take quite a bit of time)
To see what is in the DB: ```python -m app.scripts.print_database```
