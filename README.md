[Project Description](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/IDB1.html)

### Setup
NOTE: Python version is 3.4 because that is what works with the server  
From Collin:
```
so to install all of the packages and stuff look up
install with virtual env 
there's this file requirements.txt that has the python packages the project needs
I'm not super familiar with how to create an environment off of the requierments.txt cause I created the environment first and then added packages and then exported to requirements.
```

### How to Run
