[Project Description](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/IDB1.html)
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/collinc777/idb/builds)  

### Setup
NOTE: Python version must be 3.4 because that is what works with the server  

1. Our application runs python 3.4.2. Install it here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/
2. Use ```which python3.4``` to obtain the path of the newly installed python 3.4.2
3. Create a virtual environment: ```virtualenv -p <path/to/python3.4> my_project_env```  
4. Activate the virtual environment: ```source my_project_env/bin/activate```
5. Use ```python --version```. You should see ```Python 3.4.2```
6. Find this project's (idb) requirements.txt and install it: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
7. Use ```deactivate``` at any time to leave the virtual environment

### How to Test
