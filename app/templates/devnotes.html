	<h2>Use Cases</h2>
	<p>This website offers Game of Thrones fans the ability to look up detailed information on their favorite books, characters, houses, and more. We have set up an easy to use comprehensive UI that will let end users to peruse the data in a user friendly manner. Our pages map to our DB models with many foreign key relationships that link to other pages. A user can skip from alliance, to house, to character, and back with ease. We have set up a postgres DB that is populated from two separate APIs. Maintaining our own database allows us to eliminate the data overlap from the APIs having similar but different models. When we pull from the APIs we parse the data on the back-end. We have scripts to format and group the data into our DB models. Once "trimmed" we load the data into our DB with JSON. Our DB models are structured so that the front end can access all of the DB information in a simple, complete, and interconnected format. Our front-end users experience easy access to the DB so they can cross-reference their own encyclopedic knowledge. There are pages that display information by book, house, and characters. Users may also intuitively sort the information by attribute (Asc, Desc). There is also a search bar in the upper right corner of each page to quickly look up information by attribute value. As our DB grows to include more models we will build pages to match; Currently each model instance has its own page. Each instance has more than one link to other instances, of one model or another, which means that each front end page has links to related pages. End users can traverse the pages in a mapped pattern due to the intricate connection between the pages on foreign keys. Users will find this experience very similar to websites like IMDB.</p>
	
	<h2>RESTful API</h2>
	<p>Two APIs are scraped to populate our DB models. An API of Ice and Fire, and GOT API, these APIs have detailed information on each character, house, book, and location. This allows for the basic models for Character, House, and Book. The attributes of these models are slightly different across these two APIs. This causes an issue when merging the datasets. Our application runs back end scripts that "trims" and formats the dataset. The attributes of these basic models allows for the formation of more complex models, like alliances or events. The complex models use foreign keys represent relationships such as fealty (of a character or a house). The GOT API has more models than the API of Ice and Fire; such as, models for events, continents, cultures, etc. These models are not directly used by our application but can be easily utilized in future iterations. We plan to expand our DB using these models to create models for major events like wars which travers many characters, houses, regions, books, etc. These, and future, models could be linked to DB models in any number of interesting ways.</p>
	<p>In our most recent iteration we developed an API for our own DB that can be used by developers in the future to populate their own websites. Our API is detailed: apiary.apib file. The crux of the API is that it can be referenced by model type and specific instance. End users can use GET on routes /api/model. This will return a JSON file with all of the information contained in the model. That data would need to be properly parsed and displayed to make any kind of sense to end users but any competent developer should be able to easily take our API end points and use them to their own purposes. Our API also has optional arguments kwargs which can be used to filter and sort the results. The filter options are availible for each of the human redable attributres; i.e.  name, author, publisher, ISBN, etc. The filter options are specific to each model. When our API is utilized it develops a JSON file on the query (filters and sort options). A developer is then able to use these files to populate their own models or simply to visualize our data, as can be seen: ____. To do this we used the D3.js which is a javascript library specifically for visualizing DB information. It works by binding attributes to DOM ( Document Object Models) and then outputting to HTML/JSON. There are further options to select on attribute and filter.</p>
	
	<h2>DB Models</h2>

	<h3>Character Model:</h3>
	<p>The Character model contains the following attributes: ID, house, culture, title(s), spouse, died, aliases, date of death, name, born, gender, father, allegiances, pov books, played by, books, tv series, mother</p>
	<p>The Character model is referenced in four DB relationships, books_characters, books_povCharacters, house_swornMembers, and alliance_members. In this fashion the Character model is connected to every other DB model; it is the basic unit of our application. We use these relations to populate: books, povBooks, swornHouses, and Alliance.</p>
	<div class="image">
	<img src="static/img/character.png" alt="CharMod" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;">
	<div align="center">PK: ID  FK: House, spouse, father, mother, alliance</div>
	</div>
	<p>The Character model describes a person, animal, or creature that appeared in any book or media relating to the series "A Game of Thrones." Each distinct character is an instance of this model with some required, and some optional, attributes. The ID is the primary key but our front end allows sorting on name, house, culture or gender. Each character instance page also contains preloaded media associated with that ID. The problem with pulling from two differen APIs however, is that there are some redundant attributes like "male" and "gender" in the same model. We plan to optimize out this redundancy in future iterations. Furthermore, the Character model links to the Books, Houses, and Alliances models so that users can switch back and forth between examining specific character data and more general groups of data. Each model instance has foreign keys for house, spouse, father, mother, and books; these links can be followed to the appropriate instance of that model and hence from there. We referee to the Characters model as our base because it is a member of each of the other models. Many models contain lists of characters like house and alliance members; yet the character model itself links to only one house and/or alliance. Each instance is linked in some way to the rest of the DB because some required attributes double as foreign keys. For example, by definition an instance of the Character model must have a house, therefore the page showing that instance will have a link to a house instance, with its own page. Most instances have many foreign key relationships to other model instances which explodes the number of potential paths for the end user. In future, we can create complex models to model the relationship between characters like a pact, vendetta, or scheme. Almost any potential model we could add to our DB would link to the basic Character model; which is why it is the central model that links books, houses, and alliances together. </p>

	<h3>Book Model:</h3>
	<p>The Book model contains the following attributes: ID, number of pages, ISBN number, title, publisher, country of origin, list of POV characters, author, media type, release date, list of all characters.</p>
	<p>There are two many-to-many relationships in our DB for books; books_characters and books_povCharacters, which link to the Character model. It uses these relationships to populate: povCharacters and characters.</p>
	<div class="image">
	<img src="static/img/book.png" alt="UML" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;">
	<div align="center">PK: ID, ISBN  FK: list of characters, list of POV characters</div>
	</div>
	<p>The Book model represents one of the many literary installments in the "A Song of Fire and Ice" series. This model allows our website to give the end user all pertinent data regarding any given book at a glance. It has an ID for a primary key and several lists of characters (regular and POV) which act as foreign keys to the Character model. There are unique constraints on the ISBN and ID attributes which allows us to link the Book model to other models. There are also basic required attributes that provide metrics for each book instance: number of pages, title, publisher, and country of origin. We currently have search and filtering options on the following attributes: name, ISBN, author, publisher, and release date. We could extend the functionality of our books model by adding foreign keys as we add new and complex models. Any model that deals with a person or event that takes place in the book should be linked back to the appropriate instance on ID. Each book covers a massive amount of characters, places, and events that should be linked to the book so that it can later be referenced later. Each book instance ends up being a container for the models that appear per book. Currently the basic relationship behavior between book and character allows our end users to group characters by book and then examine each in detail. We can even differentiate main characters from supporting roles due to the separation of POV and all character sets. The Book model is currently small and inconsequential but as our DB models grow it will become an important way to group models. </p>

    <h3>House Model:</h3>
    <p> The House model contains the following attributes: ID, current lord, founder, heir, cadet branches, founded, died out, titles, coat of arms, words, seats, overlord, name, sworn members, region, and ancestral weapons. </p>
    <p>There is one one-to-many relationship, house_swornMembers, with the Character model. We use this relation (the subset of characters belonging to the Alliance) to populate: currentLord, founder, heir, overloard, and swornMembers.</p>
    <div class="Image">
    <img src="static/img/house.png" alt="UML" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div align="center">PK: ID  FK: lord, heir, cadet branches, sworn members</div>
    </div>
    <p>The House model groups characters together based on the family they belong to or lord they owe allegiance to. However, houses are much more than a simple collection of characters. Each house has many defining characteristics that uniquely identify them within the fantasy world of "A Song of Ice and Fire". Characteristics like family motto ("words"), strategic points they control ("seats"), and ownership of weapons ("ancestral weapons"). Many characters can be sworn to a house, and an entire house can be sworn to another house (i.e. Karstark -> Stark). This forms the basis for the house relationships, detailed above, that make the literary series so interesting. Having our House model mimic the increasingly complex relationship between houses in "A Song of Ice and Fire" provides the end user with endless relations to investigate. As we move forward, this allows us to create complex models like an Alliance Model that groups houses/characters into trees of allegiance. In addition, we can expand the relationships between houses such as rivalries, wars, and debts. Models of these events would use the house's ID as foreign key to associate them with a particular house in our database; to that end, each house instance has a ID primary key along with an optional list of house IDs to use as Foreign keys for cadet branches. The relationships in the House model allows users to visualize the complex relationships between the houses in a realistic way. Houses also have attributes for coat of arms and words which are displayed on each houses page as static media. In future iterations, this functionality can be extended to include media linked to castles("seats") or ancestral weapons. The Houses page currently sorts on name, region, coat of arms, or words. </p>

    <h3>Alliance Model:</h3>
    <p> The Alliance model contains the following attributes: ID, head leader, members, weapons, seats, regions, and cultures. </p>
    <p>The Alliance model uses the existing relationships between the Characters, Houses; it could be further extended to include the Books model relations. Currently it uses the relations to populate: headLeader and members. In future, it can be improved in further iterations to link to key events (like assassination of a leader) or other models we implement. </p>
    <div class="Image">
    <img src="static/img/alliance.png" alt="UML" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div align="center">PK: ID  FK: Leader, members</div>
    </div>
    <p>The Alliances Module creates groups of houses based on the tree structure of the allegiance attribute. The leader of the root house of the allegiance tree is the head leader of the alliance, as is only natural. For example, Stark would be the leader of the North Alliance. Every house in the alliance contributes its members, weapons, seats, regions, and cultures to the overall alliance. The primary keys for these attributes are combined to create master lists for the alliance's metrics. The Alliance model acts as an aggregate super model of house because some conflicts/events take place at the Alliance level, rather than the house or personal(character) level. Because we aggregate the data the user is able to actually quantify the strengths of each alliance. As we add models to our DB we can utilize the Alliance model as a foreign key for events that take place on the grand scale of alliances. Each instance has a page that displays the crests of the most powerful four houses in the alliance as well as all of the alliance attributes. We can further extend the page to display the regions an alliance controls or ancestral weapons if we can find images. As previously discussed, this model could be further extended to include significant historical events (i.e. wars) that the alliance participated in and even which characters from the alliance died. Currently we have the ability to sort on name, leader, and number of sworn members. </p>
    <p>This is a completely original model that does not appear in either of the APIs but joins data from both. This model and others that can be created from the existing data sets are what compose the majority of our site's functionality. Just like we did to create the Alliance Module; we can create complex models that link the basic Character, House, and Book models. This will allow the end user to see more interesting data sets than just a list of every single character, book, or house. </p>

	<h2>Tools</h2>
	<h3>Front-End Tools</h3>
	<p>Our front-end is run on flask templates that build dynamic HTML pages. We have a base html page that includes the navigation bar and headers that all other pages extend. This way we can expand our front-end dynamically and always maintain consistency across pages. We also include a context function that highlights the navigation entry corresponding with the currently active page. This tiny detail nonetheless adds style and sophistication to the UI. Each model has a branch page that is a grid of model instances. Each model instance has its own dynamic page that lists all of its pertinent data from the APIs. As previously discussed, each page instance has one or more links to other page instances. Flask is especially useful because we can easily add templates to instruct it to build pages based on new models we add. This allows our website to scale because every time we build a new model flask is able to create pages for each instance of that model based off of the template we define. These templates can be defined so that they display the correct subset of information from our models as well as any linked image files in the API. </p>
	<p>Our program utilizes React.js to add a dynamic element to our listing pages. We have prexisting JSON endpoints that we use AJAX to update on sort, filter or page change action. The AJAX model has functions for sortData (with params: field, ascending), filterData (with param: filterText) or changePage(with param: page). The URL is built by page, sortParam, sortAscending, and filterText before being sent to the AJAX API. There are jsx scripts to control the grid and listing layouts, as well as sort, filter and pagination layouts. This allows us to hit our API for filtering/sorting and update the page in realtime. React.js was especially useful for this application because we didn't need to do any dynamic creation of HTML elements, we simply updated the state of each component (grid, pagination, filter, sort) and React.js took care of rendering the updated components. We did not get a chance to update the detail pages for each model to use React.js components, but we did not feel a need to do this because these pages are static for the most part. Although they are generated dynamically using Flask, they don't react to any user input or contain any state, so we left them as Flask generated templates. </p>
	<p>One of the issues we ran into using React.js was the concept of closures. Thankfully, reading the Javascript (only the good parts) textbook that had assigned readings throughout the semester helped with solving these problems. For example, when displaying the list of page links for the pagination component, we used a for loop with a variable named "i". Due to the fact that we initially did not capture its state with a closure, every page had the same number i (the value of i at the end of the loop). To solve this problem, we did the work of creating the elements inside a function closure and passed it the value of i. This solved our problem and allowed us to use this technique in many other places, such as the Sorting component, that has a variable number of sorting parameters and ascending/descending.</p>
	
	<h3>Back-End Tools</h3>
	<p>Our application uses the standard requests and JSON library to query the APIs we use to populate our models and images. After we have received the JSON data dumps we use trim scripts to format the data into the desired input format. Firstly, we determine which entity we are dealing with which defines which attributes are required. Then we break the data into its required fields which allows us to populate our models fully while throwing out unneeded data. We use all of the information provided by the APIs to populate our DB and extrapolate aditional information from the instance relationships. The complexity comes in when you take into account the differences between the two API data sets, as discussed previously. For example, in GOT API a name may be listed as Eddard Stark while on the API of Ice and FIre the name would be listed as Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfel. In order to resolve this issue, we search for names as sub strings so Eddard Stark would be returned because it is a sub string of both listed names. This way we are ensuring that we don't have duplicate instances of a particular model. Unfortuntely this creates a source of error that can only be controlled by creating a very specific scripts/method to handle each data type or set. We did so, creating a script called trimdata.py which does all of the back-end formatting work before saving cached JSON data to disk. Our site then uses scripts to expedite the rote tasks of creating, filling, cleaning, and viewing our database. These scripts are located in the 'app/scripts' directory.</p>
	<p>The first of these scripts is the 'fill_database.py' which, as the name implies, performs that task of filling our database with data. The data is loaded from a set of JSON files that were created by scraping our chosen APIs. To prevent duplicate values from appearing in our database, our fill database script also drops the current database, and then recreates it. We encountered several interesting technical challenges when constructing these scripts. The first of these technical challenges concerned destroying and then restoring the database. This proved challenging because SQL does not permit tables to be dropped if they have a certain dependency structure as related to other tables. In order to solve this issue we had to ensure that our tables are dropped in the proper order, or in a cascading manner. This solution can is implemented in the 'drop_everything' function. The second technical challenge was how to deal with inconsistent data from the API. The API we were using lacked data for certain fields, and as a result would sometimes result in a NULL value, causing errors in our models. Our solution to this error was to restructure the input JSON files so that all undefined values had a acceptable default value.</p>
	<p>The second of these scripts is 'print_database.py'. This script is responsible for printing all elements of the database to the console, to aid in visualization of our data. The script is straightforward in function, it first identifies all the tables and models present in the database, and then it prints out each instance of a model. is then able to use this data without making constant calls to the API and having to trim each new dataset. We populate the DB from the cached information on init, after checking if the data is already loaded into the DB.</p>
	<h4>Search</h4>
	<p>The newest iteration of our application includes a complex search feature on the navigation header of each page. The search bar can be used at any time and will redirect to a search result page that is dynamically built using React and flask. Our cached search results for common models/queries are saved in compressed pickle files in the data directory. We then search that information on the backend and dynamically create result pages for the end-user. The pickled data allows us to quickly return results for most query's without slow and tedious calls to the back end API. Our DB's API has end points to search quickly through our models, using their attributes as a guide, our API is detailed here: apaiary.apib. As the documentation states we have end points for each model and filters on each attribute that it made sense to create one for. A developer can use our API to create JSON files, filtered and sorted per their params, which can then contain our DB model information. A great example of this is at: ___ which uses our API to visualize the data - this is part of a classroom assignment and has little to do with our DBs theme. Likewise, the information visualized at: ____ is from a classmate’s API, set up in a similar fashion. The search feature only uses the API when there isn't sufficient data in our search from the cached pickle files. Some great things about our search is that it can be run on any search string including but not limited to Arrays, IDs, and statements with AND / OR components. The query is broken up into a list of properties which each become their own search. The results are then collated, via a flask template, on to a search result page. The pertinent search strings are highlighted within the models and sorted based on result "weight". This allows end users to implement powerful searches over our entire DB. The searches are restricted to each model's human readable attributes (everything except for images and IDs). The results are then weighted by the amount of times the search string (in full or in part) appears in the model. We then use React to implement pagation for searches that return more results than can comfortably fit on a page. As a special added feature, when our end user clicks a link from the search page it goes to the appropriate page and scrolls down to the proper portion of the page. For example, searching for Warden of the North will link to the Eddard Stark page and automatically scroll down to #Titles on page load. This simple, and purely aesthetic, design choice gives our application an easy to use seamless search engine that is end user proof.</p>

	<h3>Embedding-Media Tools:</h3>
	<p>We have embedded a carousel of images on the home page, populated from prestored images. In our most recent iteration each model has an associated image which is a huge improvement over using default images. In addition to the main page carasoul each model: houses, characters, books and alliances; all have embeddable media on their detail pages. This image is usually the same as that displayed on their card on the grid pages. In the prepopulate step, we have a script that checks for, and downloads, the image associated with the instance. Subsequent scrips link the preloaded images with their model instance so that it is properly linked to the card and detail page. Characters and houses both get their embedded media from the resources hosted on api.got.show, and the books get their embedded media from the cover-art associated with them. The embedded media for each alliance is simply built out of the largest 4 houses' crests that make up that alliance. The cards mentioned above are instance, "branch" pages, Characters, Houses, Books, and Alliances, are broken up into grids of media containers called cards which allows the end user to quickly identify which instance a card is referencing. We organize our pages like this so that we can sort the branch pages easily without having to make AJAX calls. In addition to the page related media we have also added media on this page to illustrate the models and UML. Having images associated with each model is mostly for the end user. It adds a lot of complexity to the application and doesn't provide any additional information for our models. That being said the ascetic of a website is as important as the usefulness of the information because an end user's satisfaction is a function of the quality of our application. </p>

	<h2>Planning</h2>
	<p>
		We used <a href="http://www.planitpoker.com"> plan it poker </a> to strategize about how long each part of the project would take. It works by choosing a task or bug, and then everyone makes a guess about how long it will take by choosing a card. When everyone has made a choice, we flip our cards to show other people. This is useful because it prevents our individual opinions from being tainted by one another. That is, if someone thinks a task will take 2 hours but someone else thinks it will take 6 hours, it will often skew the first perception toward a longer amount of time.

	<h2>Hosting</h2>
	<p>For hosting we decided to use Amazon Web Service(AWS). We decided AWS’s Elastic Beanstalk was the perfect hosting platform for our project because it supported the flask framework. We used the flask framework to structure our front-end and make sure it was scallable to any number of instances. Elastic Beanstalk (EB for short) does not support everything and that’s why it is key that it supports flask.  Elastic beanstalk not only acts as a host environment, but it adds some nice extra functionality on top of it, such as giving itself a URL right off the start. The next reason we chose to use it is that the applications deployment process across machines can easily be replicated due to the AWS elastic beanstalk cli. Beanstalk also reduces the management complexity for our application by handling capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling. It also offers application health monitoring.  Beanstalk also has a nice versioning system so that we can easily roll back our application upon failed deployment, or because of deploying bad code. </p>
	<p>The step by step setup of the project goes as follows. (Prerequisite: you must have Python3.4, pip, virtualenv, and the awsebcli installed to perform the next steps. You must also have the idb repo locally)</p>
	<h4>Create a virtualenv</h4>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">    virtualenv ~/eb-virt</p>
	<h4>Activate virtualenv</h4>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">    source ~/eb-virt/bin/activate</p>
	<h4>Navigate to IDB and install requirment</h4>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">    pip install -r idb/requirment.txt</p>
	<h4>Initialize eb clie repo</h4>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">    eb init -p python2.7 flask tutorial</p>
	<h4>Create an eb environment to deploy application into</h4>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">    eb create flask-env</p>
	<p>To make deployment to beanstalk even simpler and to make development more streamlined, we used Pycharm’s built in Elastic Beanstalk plugin to handle deployment as a run configuration. This plugin syncs with your AWS account. Allows you to select and environment to deploy to and streamlines deployment whenever the user is ready to deploy by selecting the Elastic Beanstalk run configuration. </p>
	<p>Our travis.yml file is configured to automatically deploy the application on each build. The build runs our application tests and then uses the Elastic Beanstalk platform to deploy the front end on AWS. This is a great feature because it allows developers to freely alter files while ensuring the unit tests still pass on each build. Our unit tests ensure that each model is set up correctly and that their foreign key relationships work as expected. If the unit tests don't pass than it follows that the front end links will not perform as intended. However, since our test framework is fairly comprehensive if the tests pass we can be reasonably certain the front end will work properly.</p>
	<p>In our more recent iterations we have added tests for the DB and API. In order to properly test our DB we have to do some test environment setup and takedown. Then we are able to test the add and query functions for each model instance in the DB. These tests ensure we can expand our DB as the dataset grows. However, we do not check for duplicate data, conceivably one could add model instances that are duplicates with different primary key. We also created a database delete test to ensure that we can properly remove model instances without subsequently breaking links.</p>
