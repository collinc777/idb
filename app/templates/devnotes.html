	<h2>Use Cases</h2>
	<p>This website offers Game of Thrones fans the ability to look up detailed information on their favorite books, characters, houses, and more. We have set up an easy to use comprehensive AI that will let end users to puruse the data in a user friendly manner. We utilize two separate APIs to ensure the completeness of our dataset. The end user can access the DB to cross-reference their own encyclopedic knowledge. There are pages that display information by book, house, and characters. Each instance has its own static page which displays all of the pertinant data. Each page has links to related pages which allows for a continuous user experience. End users can traverse the pages in a mapped pattern due to the intricate connection between the pages on character id and house id. Users will find this experience very similar to websites like IMDB.</p>
	<h2>RESTful API</h2>
	<p>Two APIs are scraped to create the tables and relations. An API of Ice and Fire, and GOT API, these APIs have detailed information on each character, house, book, and location. This allows for the basic models for Character, House, and Book; the relationships between these datasets allow us to construct more complex models like alliances between houses. The GOT API also has models for events, continents, cultures, etc. These models could be used to extend our functionality. We can create models for major events like wars which travers many characters, houses, regions, books, etc.</p>
	<h2>Models</h2>
	<h3>Books</h3>
	<p>Books contain attributes ID, number of pages, ISBN number, title, publisher, country of origin, list of pov characters, author, media type, release date, list of all characters.
      This model allows our website to give the end user all pertinent data regarding any given book. The functionality of our books model can be extended by adding foreign keys for new and complex models. Each book covers a massive amount of characters, places, and events that can be linked to the book using our other models. Currently the basic behavior of linking this model to all of the characters that appear in the book allows our end users to examine each character in detail. We can even differentiate main characters from supporting roles due to the separation of POV and all character sets. Each row in the books table shares several attributes including author and media type, however the unique constraints on ID, name, and ISBN allow us to link complex models back to the book model and sort in a number of ways.</p>
